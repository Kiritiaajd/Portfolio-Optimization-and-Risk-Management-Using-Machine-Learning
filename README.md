# Portfolio Optimization and Risk Management Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on **optimizing investment portfolios** using advanced machine learning and quantitative techniques to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The goal is to apply **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and **Machine Learning algorithms** for **risk assessment, asset allocation, and portfolio optimization**.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand asset performance, risk, and return.
- Apply **Portfolio Optimization techniques (Markowitz model, Efficient Frontier)**.
- Implement **Machine Learning models** for portfolio risk prediction and optimization.
- Visualize results: Risk vs. Return, Efficient Frontier, Sharpe Ratio optimization.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance (for data collection)
- CVXPY / PyPortfolioOpt (optional for optimization)

## Future Scope
- Incorporating real-time data and automating portfolio rebalancing.
- Implementing advanced models like Reinforcement Learning for dynamic asset allocation.
- Risk management using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR.
